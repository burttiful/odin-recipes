    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a frying pan to medium heat.</li>

      <li>Gently rub tilapia fillets in the lemon-pepper seasoning immediately before adding to frying pan.</li>
      <li>Cook for a few minutes on each side, flipping when able to see the now-white, cooked section, esp. on the sides of the fish.</li>
      <li>Optional: Steam a side of vegetables or cook a small portion of rice to eat as a side-dish.</li>
      <li>Bon appetit!</li>
