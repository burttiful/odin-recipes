    <h4>
      Ingredients
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking Spray/Oil</li>
      <li>Flour Tortillas</li>
      <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
      <li>Shredded Cheese</li>
      <li>Desired Toppings (e.g. pepperoni)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Steps
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a frying pan to medium heat.</li>
      <li>Spray bottom of pan with a small amount of cooking spray or oil.</li>
      <li>Place a single tortilla in the pan. You should feel the bottom of the tortilla sizzle as you set it in the pan.</li>
      <li>Quickly add the tomato sauce by spooning it onto the tortilla -- enough to leave a thin layer of sauce across the entire surface.</li>
      <li>Add enough shredded cheese to cover the sauce, more or less.</li>
      <li>Add desired toppings in desired quantities.</li>
      <li>Optional: Add more cheese on top of toppings. This will help to hold the toppings in place while cutting pizza slices and eating, but is not entirely necessary.</li>
      <li>When cheese is melted, remove from pan. Let cool for approximately 5 minutes before eating. Bon appetit!</li>
    </ol>
